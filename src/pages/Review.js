              Amazing experience. I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a prewedding shoot at Sets by Nature Paradise. The service provided by the cooperative team ensures a seamless and delightful experience. The lush greenery, Veer Dam backwater, and the golden hues of the setting sun combine to make every frame a work of art. Blends nature, beautiful sets, and exceptional service. The Staff is very helpful; this was the best location, highly recommended, and thank you for the great hospitality. Special thanks to Rahul sir to make this happen so smoothly.

              "Photoshoot with Sets by Nature Paradise is so much fun! They have an incredible creative eye for shooting beautiful photos. I highly recommend her for Preweddings, family photos, and especially for Maternity shoot, Babies Shoot, blog photos. This photo shoot location is a hidden gem near Pune. The backdrop of the Veer Dam backwater with the sunset is truly magical. The waves add an extra charm to the photos. What sets this location apart is the caring and supportive managing team. The boat ride adds an adventurous touch to the shoot. Highly recommended for couples looking for a prewedding location.
